To my evaluators. 

I push additionally PA1_template.md file, so my SHA code don't match with that I submited. I didn't realize that there have to be .md file but it is my fault. 
Also my plots still don't show and they are only in Figure/ repo. Maybe you can advice me to how you pass this assingment. Still I hope you will be thoughtful by evaluation my work.
